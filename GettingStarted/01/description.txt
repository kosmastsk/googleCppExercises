The common field cricket chirps in direct proportion to the current temperature. Adding 40 to the number of time a cricket chirps in a minute, then dividing that value by 4 gives us the temperature. Write a program that takes as input the number of chirps in a minute and prints the current temperature. For example,
Number of chirps: 120
The temperature is: 40.0 degrees.
